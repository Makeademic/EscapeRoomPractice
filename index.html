<p>Agents... In preparation for one of our virtual games, Escape the Spymistress, we need to do some quick recon back to the time of the Civil War.  We've detected a change to the timeline and we think that it might have some sort of a connection with Abraham Lincoln.  We are going to send you back in time to the night of February 2nd, 1861.  A train is on route from Pennsylvania to Baltimore, Maryland well after midnight.  We know from previous scouting trips that there is very little movement onboard...which will be the perfect cover for your trip back in time.  Your mission is to sneak from train car to train car and gather evidence of what the change is to the timeline.  Can you discover the clues and get off the train before being discovered?</p>

<p>THE TIME IS 1861...
      You appear in a clearing next to some railroad tracks...empty and forlorn in the midnight air.  It's hard to even imagine a train would be traveling along the track at this hour... but it is immediately clear that something is amiss.  At your feet is a lantern, <span id="texttobered">illuminating a silver object in the grass.</span></p>
